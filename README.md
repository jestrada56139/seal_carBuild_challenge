# Algorithm
1. I made a list of things I will need and payed attention to what the challenge was recquring. Noticing the question implies we used an interface and classes, that is what I used. 
2. After I got stuck, I looked at the previous challenge to see what I did inorder to get values, but realizing it'll be different because its typescript. 
3. Getting stuck on some parts allowed me to utilize google in order to confirm an answer I was thinking about.
4. After collecting information on what I would need, I began building the application. 
5. I got confused towards the end because I didn't compile the ts files and join them using browserify.
6. I liked this challenge because it involved the use of having different components working together.
